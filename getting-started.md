# Freelance Visa

To work as a freelancer in Germany you need to have a valid residence permit / visa

## Need a residence permit for freelance work

If you are new to Germany and are interested in working as a freelancer, you need to apply for a freelancer visa.

Applying for a freelancer visa is an involved process and depends on a number of factors. <sup>4</sup>

## Already have a residence permit

If you already have a residence permit to live and work in Germany, then your permit should fall in one of the following categories

- _Aufenthaltserlaubnis (Residence Permit)_ with the remark "Erwerbstätigkeit gestattet / Selbständige Tätigkeit gestattet" (Economic activity permitted), allows the holder to work freelance. <sup>1,2</sup>
- _Aufenthaltserlaubnis (Residence Permit)_ with the remark "Beschäftigung gestattet" (Employment permitted), does not allow the holder to work freelance.<sup>1,2</sup> In this case you will need to apply for a [freelancer visa](#need-a-residence-permit-for-freelance-work).

- _Anmeldebestätigung / Meldebescheinigung (Residence Registration Certificate)_
- _Steueridentifikationsnummer / Steuerliche Identifikationsnummer / Identifikationsnummer / Steuer-IdNr. / IdNr / SteuerID (Personal Tax Identification Number)_

_Finanzamt (Tax Office)_.

This registration results in two important documents,

- _Steuernummer (Tax Number)_
- _Umsatzsteueridentifikationsnummer / Mehrwertsteuernummer / Umsatzsteuernummer / MwSt.nummer (VAT / Value Added Tax number)_ <sup>1<sup>

## Required Documents

To register at the Finanzamt you will need to submit the form called 'Fragebogen zur steuerliche Erfassung' (can be filled in [offline](https://www.berlin.de/sen/finanzen/dokumentendownload/steuern/daten-und-fakten/betriebseroeffnung-betriebseinstellung/steuerliche_erfassung_selbst__ndige_t__tigkeit_beteiligung_an_einer_personenges.pdf) or [online](https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/ffw/action/invoke.do?id=034250))

It is always preferable to have a separate bank account for your freelancing work <sup>1</sup>, as this makes it easier to deal with the Finanzamt.

Some freelancer friendly banks include,

- [kontist](https://kontist.com/en) : online freelancer specific bank account (basic version for free) with nice-to-have integrations like [FastBill](https://www.fastbill.com/en) and [debitoor](https://debitoor.de).

# Insurance

This section covers the various kinds of insurance you would need as a freelancer in Germany.

## Health

Health insurance is compulsory for everybody residing in Germany.

There are two main types of health insurance in Geramny,

### Gesetzlich (Public / Statutory)

Public insurance is primarily based on how much you earn and covers most of your day-to-day health costs.

The mandatory minimum brutto income insured is €2,283.50 / month and the maximum is €4,425 / month.

The standard government regulated premium rate is set at 14.6% of your brutto income. <sup>2</sup> Public health insurance companies can then apply an additional contribution rate or _Zusatzbeitragssatz_ to cover their operating costs. As a freelancer it may also be possible to buy public health insurance without sick pay coverage.

There is a healthy choice of public health insurance providers in Germany. <sup>4</sup>

If we take [TK](https://www.tk.de/techniker/service/leistungen-und-mitgliedschaft/versicherung/versichert-als-selbststaendige-2004588) as an example, the general Zusatzbeitragssatz is 0.9% which makes the total rate 15.5% . In addition to this, you alson need to pay for [add nursing care insurance](https://www.tk.de/techniker/service/leistungen-und-mitgliedschaft/versicherung/versichert-als-selbststaendige/haeufige-fragen-fuer-selbststaendige/hoehe-herleitung--mindestbeitrag-hauptberuflich-selbststaendige-2007008) or _Pflegeversicherung_ which adds another 2.55% per month to the premium. This implies that the mandatory minimum you **must** pay as premium would be atleast (18.05% of €2,283.50) €412 per month with the maximum as (18.05% of €4,425) €799 per month. There may be some additional surchages added to this amount. You could choose to [not include](https://www.tk.de/techniker/service/leistungen-und-mitgliedschaft/leistungen/krankengeld/selbststaendige/beitragshoehe-versicherung-krankengeld-selbststaendige-2006330) sick pay in your insurance, in which case the total rate falls (by 0.6%) to 17.45%.

### Private (Private)

Private insurance is primarily based on your age as well as other relevant risk factors and may or may not include as much coverage as a public health insurance. As compared to public health insurance, the premium for private health insurance is considerably cheaper for when you are younger but gets more costly as you get older.

There is a healthy choice of private health insurance providers in Germany. <sup>5</sup>

"Temporary health insurance from

- ALC
- Mawista
- Care Concept

is sometimes accepted when you apply for the first time. However, these companies offer very limited coverage, and you should switch to a real insurance company as soon as possible. Temporary health insurance may not be accepted when you renew your visa." <sup>6</sup>

## Professional Liability / Indemnity Coverage

"This kind of insurance protects you against the claims of third parties that have come to harm or admonish you, specifically when the third party suffers financial damage as a result of your activity."<sup>1</sup>

This can usually be combined with [Legal Expense Coverage](#legal-expense-coverage).

Some of the companies that provide professional liability / indemnity insurance include,

- [exali](https://www.exali.de/)
- [Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.de)

# Income Tax

Income Tax (Einkommensteuer) is the tax applied to the income you earn as a freelancer.

## Computation

The income tax is computed based on (currently five) tax brackets. The computation of income is progressive and depends on which tax bracket you fall under. <sup>5</sup>

The income tax brackets (2018) for individuals are as follows,

- 0 to 9000 : 0%
- 9001 to 13996 : 14% to 24% (applied progressively)
- 13997 to 54949 : 24% to 42% (applied progressively)
- 54949 to 260532 : 42% (averaged)
- from 260533 : 45% (averaged)

You can also file your tax returns as a couple, in which case the income tax brackets (2018) are as doubled,

- 0 to 18000 : 0%
- 9001 to 27992 : 14% to 24% (applied progressively)
- 27993 to 109898 : 24% to 42% (applied progressively)
- 109899 to 521046 : 42% (averaged)
- from 521047 : 45% (averaged)

Filing tax returns as a couple is beneficial for couples with two significantly different levels of income.

You need to also choose a tax class (_Steuerklasse_), when filing your tax returns. The tax classes are as follows <sup>2</sup>,

- Steuerklasse 1 : You are single, widow(er), separated/divorced
- Steuerklasse 2 : You are a single parent
- Steuerklasse 3 : You are married with a higher income (than your partner in Steuerklasse 5)
- Steuerklasse 4 : You are married with both equivalent income
- Steuerklasse 5 : You are married with a lower income (than your partner in Steuerklasse 3)
- Steuerklasse 6 : The class used for additional jobs (Nebenjob or Zweitjob)

For couples, these tax classes are only relevant so that you pay the correct amount of tax per month. So even if you opted for the wrong tax class, this will be adjusted with your year end tax return and you will get the difference refunded in full or you may have to pay back a shortfall.

The finance ministry provides basic income tax calculator, which you can find [here](https://www.bmf-steuerrechner.de/ekst/eingabeformekst.xhtml).

## Solidarity surcharge

In addition to income tax, the so-called solidarity surcharge (_Solidaritätszuschlag_ or _Soli_) is levied at a rate of 5.5% of the income tax for higher incomes. <sup>5</sup>

Up to €972 (€1,944 for married couples) annual income tax, no solidarity surcharge is levied. Above this threshold, the solidarity surcharge rate increases continuously until it reaches 5.5% when the annual income tax is €1,340.69 (€2,681.38 for married couples).

## Tax deductions

Any item / service you may have purchased for your freelance work is eligible for tax deductions.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of expenses that you can deduct from your taxable income, <sup>6</sup>

- Public transport
- Stationery
- Tickets to films, events, festivals, workshops relevant to your work
- Books, magazines and literature relevant to your work
- Hardware, software, other gear used in your work
- Gear hire eg. camera gear
- German classes
- Phone bills
- Website operation costs
- Work trips: travel and accommodation
- Insurances
- Gifts for clients: one gift per client per year, up to 40 EUR
- Meals with clients, interview subjects, etc.
- Office costs: rent and bills

## Tax Declarations / Payments

The income tax declaration or _Einkommenssteuererklärung_ and payment schedule (usually quaterly) is provided by the Finanzamt when the registration is complete. <sup>7</sup>

# VAT

"A value-added tax (VAT), known in some countries as a goods and services tax (GST), is a type of tax that is assessed incrementally, based on the increase in value of a product or service at each stage of production or distribution." <sup>2</sup>

It is a kind of 'indirect' tax payable directly to the Finanzamt and is a percentage of the amount you should charge for your services. It is important to note that if you do not charge / collect VAT, you will (yourself) have to pay the VAT for the income earned. Except for some exceptional cases, the VAT rate for freelancers is usually 19% and should be charged in addition to the service amount.<sup>3</sup>

The amount payable to the Finanzamt is the difference between the VAT amount you charge (when you invoice your clients) and the amount you pay for (when you purchase items / services for your freelance work).

To pay VAT <sup>1</sup>, you will require a VAT Identiciation Number (_Umsatzsteueridentifikationsnummer_), which you should have received as a result of the [Finanzamt registration](#finanzamt-registration).

## VAT Declarations / Payments

Advance VAT returns or _Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung_ need to be filed (and paid) every month for the first two years following which this can be done on a quarterly basis. <sup>4, 5</sup>

The yearly VAT returns or _Umsatzsteuererklärung_ (followed by payment if any) to be made for each full financial year (Jan. 1 - Dec. 31). This will simply be a cumulative total and should match all the monthly VAT returns filed through the year.

# Social Security

"Unlike normal employees, freelancers are in general not liable to the German social security system. Therefore, freelancers do not need to contribute to the governmental healthcare, unemployment and pension insurances." <sup>1</sup>

# Scheinselbstständigkeit

"_Scheinselbstständigkeit_ can be roughly translated as 'fake self-employment' and means that a working relationship between a freelancer and a client can be ruled as being too similar to that of a employee and employer to be considered 'freelance'". <sup>1</sup>

Even though working for a single client comes with its benefits, it is important to understand and mitigate the risks involved. <sup>2</sup>

# Invoices

"An invoice, bill or tab (_Rechnung_) is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer, relating to a sale transaction and indicating the products, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services the seller had provided the buyer." <sup>1</sup>

"An invoice which is subject to the German VAT must include at least the following information <sup>2</sup>:

- Date of issue
- A unique, sequential number
- The VAT number or the VAT ID number of the supplier / service provider
- Full address of the supplier / service provider and the customer
